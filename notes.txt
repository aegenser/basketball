We start with team A in possession:

Missed 2-pt -> offensive rebound -> possession continues
            -> defensive rebound -> possession ends, 0 points

Missed 3-pt -> offensive rebound -> possession continues
            -> defensive rebound -> possession ends, 0 points

Makes 2-pt -> possession ends, 2 points
           -> shooting foul -> free throw -> possession ends, 2 or 3 points

Makes 3-pt -> possession ends, 3 points
           -> shooting foul -> free throw -> possession ends, 3 or 4 points

Turnover -> possession ends, 0 points

Personal Foul by B -> possession continues
                   -> free throws

Personal Foul by A -> turnover

---
New Idea:
There are only 3 things that end possession, turnover, defensive rebound, or shot made

Only thing that is complicated,
If a shot is made, and also there is a shooting foul, a free throw made is
counted towards the previous possession.
If the free throw is not made, and there is an offensive foul the possession still continues

End of the quarter is also a possession ender

Let's write some pseudocode

homeOnOff (true if Home team is on offense, false if Home team is on defense)
jumpballResult (true if home team got it, false if away team got it)
duringFreeThrows (checks if substitutions should count for this or next possession)
currentPlayersHome
currentPlayersAway
nextPlayersHome
nextPlayersAway
firstPossession
currentPossession


beginning of game -
set current and next Players home and away
search for which team got possession after jumpball, and set jumpballResult and homeOnOff
duringFreeThrows = false


while loop (condition is not end of 4th quarter) {

check if end of quarter
end possession with 0
if end of 1st or 3rd, skip a row and set homeOnOff to (not jumpballResult)
if end of 2nd, skip a row and set homeOnOff to jumpballResult

check away for substitutions, check home for substitutions
if during duringFreeThrows, then switch next not current

check if a 2/3 pt made (offense column)
check if there was a shooting foul
if not, end possession with 2/3 points
if there is, check for free throw
if offensive rebound -> same team has possession but new possession
if defensive rebound or made -> different team has possession

check if there are free throws (offense column)
points depend on how many, one two or three
on last one:
if offensive rebound -> same team has possession but new possession
if defensive rebound or made -> different team has possession

check if there is a turnover (offense column)
end possession as is
start possession with defense

check if there is a defensive rebound
end possession as is
start possession with defense
